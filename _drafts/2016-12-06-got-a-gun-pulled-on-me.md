title: got a gun pulled on me
---

I was interning at a company in San Francisco at the time and it was about 3 o'clock in the morning. We were out late at night and I called an Uber to bring me back home. During this term, I lived in a quiet neighborhood. The street that I lived in was a one way street where cars would park on both sides of the road, leaving only one effective lane to drive in.

Anyways, it was night time and everyone's cars were parked along the road, and we pulled up to the front of my house. Before I could even get out of the car, I suddenly see ambulance sirens behind my Uber car. "How is the ambulance going to get through our Uber with all these cars double parked on the street?", I thought to myself. Immediately, all I thought about was to get all my stuff from the car, and run out of my Uber so that my driver can quickly leave, and the ambulance can get through. However, I froze. I couldn't decide what to do. My driver then gave me the gesture that it was okay for me to get off the car, so without thinking much about it after that, I grabbed all my stuff and ran out of the car.

"GET BACK IN THE CAR!", I hear behind me as I'm quickly leaving the car. I freeze and I turn around. To my surprise, the ambulance that I thought was there, was actually a police car. The police was shouting at me. "GET BACK IN THE CAR!", he said again, as I realized he was pointing a gun at me. Scared and shocked, I slowly get back inside the car, and tell my driver that he point a gun at me.

A few moments later, he came up to the car and calmly asked if this was an Uber ride. It was. Calmly, I explained that I didn't mean to look as suspicious as I did, and that I thought it was an ambulance. He was understanding, and was apologetic as well. All and all, everything turned out to be okay.

I was just thinking about police brutality and how I could have easily been very hurt or dead. Adrenaline was pumping the rest of the night, but I got a cool headline of a story to tell.
