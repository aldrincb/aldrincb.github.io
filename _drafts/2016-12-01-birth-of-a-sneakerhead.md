I was studying abroad in Singapore earlier this year and after ruining my pair of Converse shoes from traveling around South East Asia, I found myself in desperate need of **new shoes**.

For a while now, I've been simply replacing my old Converse with a new pair of Converse shoes. In the past three years, I've owned a pair of gray, navy blue, black, and white converse sneakers and they were all the same style. I've decided that this time, I wanted the change things up. I've never really been picky with what kind of clothes I wear and as long as they good quality and versatile pieces, it would be a purchase for me. This time around was different. I wanted to get myself a nice new pair of sneakers.

Like how all of my interests start, I always do research on the topic. Instagram is my go to source for inspiration and I went to and started actively looking at accounts that posted sneaker photos. Lucky for my most of the people that I usually follow are urban explorers, and those type of people and sneakers usually come hand and hand. I started looking everyone around me and what shoes they were wearing. All I could was that Singaporeans really like the Nike Roshe. I’ve seen them before in San Francisco, but I was never really a fan. Everyone was wearing Roshes and eventually, they grew on me. I wanted to get myself a nice pair of clean Roshes. The me now would never be caught wearing Roshes. Don’t get me wrong though, it is a nice shoe, but its too common for me to like now. I’m more attracted to items with some sort of exclusivity. So did I end up buying them? No. I was running very low on money, and I still had to complete another study at Waterloo, which I needed to pay for.

Tubular Novas

Anyways, fast forward to being back in Canada. I was back studying at Waterloo and my US tax return finally came in and I had money again. I decided that it was time to buy shoes for real now! I’ve continued researching for shoes and I fell in love with Yeezys and Adidas, and the Tubular Nova Prime Knit in particular. I went to the mall in Waterloo in search for my beloved Tubular Novas, and as it turned out, these shoes were definitely not easy to find. It was also a total bust for other sneakers. Stock was pretty bad, and none of the other shoes appealed to me. I checked adidas online later that day, and apparently, the Tubular Novas was only in stock at the United Kingdom. I was sad. It was time to move on and just try to find some alternative nice sneakers.

I came home from Waterloo the next weekend and I looked online for sneaker stores in Toronto. I found a couple, so I drove down and checked them out. There was a small Adidas store right where I parked so I immediately just walked in to see what was in stock. Almost instantly, my eyes caught the Tubular Novas that I’ve been looking for. They had my size! But they were not in the color-way that I wanted, but I still tried them on and I just needed to have them.

Kobe 11s

While all of this was happening, I’ve also picked up a new hobby of playing volleyball. After getting blisters from playing in Converse, I decided I needed to get some volleyball shoes. I ended up hunting down some Kobe 11s and driving down to Toronto again to pick them up. Because of volleyball, I would go home every weekend to play with my friends, and every weekend, I would go to the mall just to look at shoes. One day Ultraboosts were in stock at Sportschek, and I just had to have them. So, in a very short amount of time, I’ve acquired 3 pairs of shoes.

And that’s how it started. Between the sneaker subreddit, and youtube videos, my addiction grew and grew. Looking back, I've always seemed to care about shoes more than any other article of clothing. I guess it just took some growing up and having money to finally dive deep into this expensive hobby of sneaker collecting. Since then, I’ve acquired some more pairs of shoes. Maybe I’ll do another post about my collection another time.
