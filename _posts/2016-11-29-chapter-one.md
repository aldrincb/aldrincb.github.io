Starting today, I will try to write about something **everyday.**

Why? Well, two days ago, we were driving back to San Francisco from our "Friends-giving" Thanksgiving trip from Los Angeles. I was the driver for our whole trip and the nine hour drive back would've been brutal if it wasn't for the lovely company I've been blessed with. We played road games, listened to music, and bonded through talking. The sun set early at around 17:00. The roads were filled with cars, moving slowly, and everyone was taking a nap except for my friend sitting in the front passenger seat, giving me directions and making sure that I wouldn't zone out, which happened a few times, and they called me out on it. After being in traffic a little while, they asked me to tell them an interesting story.

It was a hard question. I've never been good at telling stories and I wanted to impress them with a super exciting and action-packed story. I was thinking about things that happened in my life. I've travelled the world all my life, experienced dramatic relationships, had near-death experiences, but at that moment I couldn't think of a story to tell. I felt that even if I could tell my story, it wouldn't nearly as exciting as how it happened, because of my story telling skills.

"Uhhhhmmmmm", I held for ten seconds, before giving up and turning the question back at them. They told their story.
...
"I could've died"
...
"I made a wish"
...
"What wish would you make?", they asked.

"Uhhhhmmmmm", I held for another ten seconds. "I don't know." All I could think of is that I'm terrible at answering these open ended question, and maybe I'm just not a good conversationalist in general. It's true. I'm introverted, and I stumble my words around new people, and I can't feel like I can be myself until I'm comfortable around them. Anyways, they continued their story.

...
"And that's my story"
...

Holy shit. What a story. I was inspired. After hearing it, I did some self-reflecting on my life and the stories of my life. Like I said before, there are some interesting tales in the life of Aldrin. I just need to remember them and I would want be able to tell them well. So here's my platform. I want to treat this as a self-improvement exercise. Self-improvement in multiple areas of my life. I want to improve my story telling skills. I want to be occupied with daily work to reduce laziness. I want to be well-spoken. I want to remember my life as I live it and I want to share it. Through this blog or whatever you want to call it, I hope to achieve these goals and more.
