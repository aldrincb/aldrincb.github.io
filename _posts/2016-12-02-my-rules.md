Here are **five rules** I found somewhere sometime ago.

 I made it a point to remember these rules in everything I did and to try to make myself a better person, but this was a long time ago when I had a period of time where feeling a little blue. What do these mean to me now?

1. **Don't ignore your dreams.**

 I've been sticking to this. I remember defining a goal for myself when I decided to follow these rules. You could call this goal as a dream I'm trying to reach for. Since then, the goal hasn't changed.

2. **Don't work too much.**

 I definitely haven't been. Sometimes I think I'm having too much fun, which isn't bad, but I'm becoming an adult now. My time is more limited, and I need to find a good balance between playing and working.

3. **Say what you think.**

 I have an introverted personality, and this is really hard for me. I do believe that I'm getting better at this. The idea of this blog is help with this as well. This is my platform to say what I think.

4. **Cultivate friendships.**

 This past year, I've made a lot of new friendships. I couldn't be anymore happy with all the great people that I've met in my life so far. My only wish is for the relationships that I've made to not slowly fade into nothing. This is something I need to work on.

5. **Be happy.**

:)

All in all, still a work in progress.
