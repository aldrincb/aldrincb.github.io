# Experience
## if(we)
### Accelerator | Software Engineer | San Francisco | Fall 2016
I enjoyed working at if(we) so much the first time that I decided to return as an intern for the second time. I joined the Accelerator team this time around, where I mostly did iOS development for multiple projects that the team was working on. On top of that, I did a bit of backend work. Along with the following accomplishments, I was also awarded the Most Valuable Intern award for all my accomplishments:
* Engineered iOS video editing component to be used in product MVPs, eventually becoming the core component of several new products
* Assisted in making a software license purchasing decision by creating technical report of benchmarked face recognition & tracking software
* Increased engagement in mobile game called Fandom, by implementing decay algorithm of in-game currency in all platforms
* Created video sharing application based around viral challenges as a side project, resulting with if(we) offering compensation to continue developing app after internship ended


## if(we)
### iOS | Software Engineer | San Francisco | Fall 2015
During my internship at if(we), I was able to contribute heavily to the newly revamped Hi5 and Tagged iOS applications. I was given real responsibilities and was able to hone my Objective-C skills through them.
* Implemented new login- & registration-flow pages in revamped Hi5 & Tagged app used by 50M unique visitors & 5.4M monthly users
* Added run-time debugging & app configuration capabilities to Hi5 & Tagged iOS apps by implementing various internal tools resulting in increased developer productivity
* Increased user engagement & retention by adding account-focused user on-boarding flow screens

## Apple
### Interactive Media Group | Software Engineer | Cupertino | Winter 2015
This internship was my first time working in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I fell in love with California during this term. The tech culture intrigued me and inspired me to continually grow as a person. During my time at Apple, my responsibilities included:
* Developed internal CLI tool for reliable control of AirPlay on iOS & OS X, becoming the core component to several new testing tools
* Executed daily AirPlay tests & created reports automatically by creating modular scripts
* Streamlined network playback & streaming regression test cases by implementing UIAutomation resulting in reduced manual testing

## Imaggle
### iOS | Software Engineer | Tokyo | Summer 2015
Imaggle was a startup in Tokyo, Japan. It was an application where people could sell their fashion items to each other. These types of applications were very successful and popular in Japan. This term was my first real work experience in iOS after learning it through side projects. I learned a lot during my time there. And Japan was just amazing to travel to.
* Raised Imaggleâ€™s rank from Top 100 to Top 40 Catalogue Apps in the Japanese AppStore by implementing one-click viral sharing resulting in 378% increase in app downloads
* Improved delivery experience by developing Uber-like real-time visual tracking interface using GPS & iBeacons
* Added product curation capabilities by developing internal app for featuring items in the consumer app
