# Experience
## if(we)
### Accelerator | Software Engineer | San Francisco | Fall 2016
I enjoyed working at if(we) so much the first time that I decided to return as an intern for the second time. I joined the Accelerator team this time around, where I mostly did iOS development for multiple projects that the team was working on. On top of that, I did a bit of backend work. Along with the following accomplishments, I was also awarded the Most Valuable Intern award for all my contributions:
* Ideated, prototyped, tested and validated video editing app for new products
* Researched and benchmarked face recognition and tracking software to help company make license purchasing decision
* Changed mechanics in iOS game, increasing circulation of in-game currency

## if(we)
### iOS | Software Engineer | San Francisco | Fall 2015
During my internship at if(we), I was able to contribute heavily to the newly revamped Hi5 and Tagged iOS applications. I was given real responsibilities and was able to hone my Objective-C skills through them.
* Implemented FTUX pages (log in and registration) in revamped iOS app
* Developed debugging tool which allowed for run-time viewing and editing of the iOS applicationâ€™s configuration files and property lists
* Added various features (pinches) which increased user engagement

## Apple
### Interactive Media Group | Software Engineer | Cupertino | Winter 2015
This internship was my first time working in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I fell in love with California during this term. The tech culture intrigued me and inspired me to continually grow as a person. During my time at Apple, my responsibilities included:
* Developed iOS and OS X command line tool for reliable control of AirPlay to minimize manual inefficiency and aid in automation tests
* Created modular automation script for executing tests and creating reports
* Implemented user interface automation scripts for streaming and network playback test cases to streamline regression tests

## Imaggle
### iOS | Software Engineer | Tokyo | Summer 2015
Imaggle was a startup in Tokyo, Japan. It was an application where people could sell their fashion items to each other. These types of applications were very successful and popular in Japan. This term was my first real work experience in iOS after learning it through side projects. I learned a lot during my time there. And Japan was just amazing to travel to.
* Implemented viral sharing; Raised app rank from top 100 to top 40 in the Japanese catalogue category of AppStore (378% increase in downloads)
* Developed UBER-like real-time visual interface using GPS and iBeacons to improve user experience
* Created internal app for curating products in the client app from scratch -->
